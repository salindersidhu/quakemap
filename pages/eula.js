              agreement between you and Quakemap;
            </p>
            <p>
              This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our
              Quakemap software (&quot;Software&quot;) directly from Quakemap or
              indirectly through a Quakemap authorized reseller or distributor
              (a &quot;Reseller&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the
              installation process and using the Quakemap software. It provides
              a license to use the Quakemap software and contains warranty
              information and liability disclaimers.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you register for a free trial of the Quakemap software, this
              EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking
              &quot;accept&quot; or installing and/or using the Quakemap
              software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and
              agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.

              If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a
              company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
              authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms
              and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not
              agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not
